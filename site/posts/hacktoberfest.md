We'll be honest here and say it was a last minute stroke of inspiration that started it all but, nearing our standard first thursday of the month and our speaker lineup for october was thin. At the same time I'd spend the last month mentoring as part of Mozilla Open Leadership program again, which was gearing up to have project participate in Hacktoberfest, a global month long celebration of open source designed to get people engaged with open source projects on github. For those unfamiliar with the pltform, github is one of many code repositories where open projects live and anyone is able to copy, modify and even contribute to open source projects!

And what better way than the promise of stickers and a free t-shirt at completion of the hacktoberfest challenge! And what is the challenge? Making four contributions (pull requests) to any open source project betwwen the 1st and the 31st of October.

Many project owners had labelled specific issues up and we noticed there were many [rOpenSci projects]() that needed rstats help.

Given that doing is the best way to learn and that as software developers, we all quite enjoy hacking on others people's projects (the urge intesifies as our own deadlines approach), we thought it'd be a great idea to forego the standard talk meetup format this month and instead opt for some hands on hactoberfest action. It would also give the opportunity to R users who were curious but did not have previous experience with github and open source to learn more throigh prectice and also in a space where they could get help with any questions or uncertainties. Working the details through on twitter (as you do these days), an exciting plan was beginning to emerge...not only would we extend to weekly sessions throughout the whole month, we would end with a special Halloween celebratory session!

## Kick off meetup - briefing session


At the kick off meetup, fellow R Users Group co-organisers Tamora ([\@soaypim](https://twitter.com/soayipm)) and Matt introduced participants to **the general ideas and principles of open source**, discussed **contibuting to open projects**, **introduced github** and walked through **scanning issues, forking reporsitories and making pull requests** (sending congtributions...yes it's confusing we know!). Given the short turnaround to prepare for the session, the materials provided by digital ocean on their [Hacktoberfest event kit page](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/eventkit) were an invaluable resource and we can eeasily recomend them as a great introduction to **contributing to open source.

## The sessions

Admittedly when you work at a computer all day, spending another 3 hours at your screen voluntarily is probably not everyone's top choice. But I found the opportunity to carve some time to explore the huge variety of potential projects and diverse ways in which to get involved both interesting and in some ways quite relaxing. The great collaborative spaces available for booking at the university, the informal setting and hanging out with friends made the sessions something I actually looked forward to. And the "no pressure" aspect of voluntary contribution meant I was free to play around, follow my own curiousity and explore things I was interested in but don't necessarily get the time to work with during my normal working day.

## Halloween R-stravaganza

Finally it was time for the closing event, our Halloween Hacktoberfest special! Excitement was building from the day before when Tamora and I spent the evening carving our **too cute to be scary `octocat`** :heart: **spooky `R`**!

We also got some cnady donations from Sheffield RSE so the stage was set for a successful finale!

## Success!

While we all got our t-shirts I was really impressed with Tamora and Raniere's the contributions and their approach served as a the biggest take-away for me. They both focused on a problem or feature that would improve something they were already interested in / used. They got feedback on their suggestion before they even begun by opening an issue on github and interact with the projects owners about their idea. That meant their efforts were well focused and much more liekly to be accepted.

As for me, well I'll be honest, my t-shirt was mainly earned by helping with typos! Sadly they main thing I worked on over the session for a variety did not end up making the cut to submit as a functional PR. Instead there'll be a personal blog about the experience, coming soon. Mostly however **I loved the experinence and already looking forward to organising next year!**
