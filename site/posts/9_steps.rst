I attended the `Software Sustainability Institute's <http://www.software.ac.uk/>`_ `Collaborations Workshop <http://www.software.ac.uk/cw16>`_ last month. This annual workshop is one of the primary events in the Research Software Engineering calendar and I highly recommend going to one if you are involved in the development of research software in any way.

One of the things I worked on was a collaborative blog post called `9 steps for quality research software <http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2016-04-05-9-steps-quality-research-software>`_.  I also wrote an article about some of the work I do called `The accident and emergency of Research Software Engineering. <http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5997>`_
