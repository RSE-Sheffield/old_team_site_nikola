My name is **Mozhgan Kabiri Chimeh** and I am a [Research Associate/Research Software Engineer](http://www.rse.ac.uk/) who specialises in performance acceleration targeting Many-core and Multi-core architectures. Research is my passion and I have carefully developed my education with research and teaching in mind. I completed my PhD in computer science in 2016 at the University of Glasgow where my area of research was accelerating logic gate circuit simulation targeting heterogeneous architectures.  As part of my PhD project, I optimised and accelerated simulation algorithms and applied them to various parallel architectures (SIMD enabled machines, clusters, and GPUs). I have practical experience with parallel programming using High Performance Computing languages and models including OpenMP and CUDA.

I am glad to be a part of RSE team as well as working as a researcher in Computer Graphic and simulation modelling group here at the University of Sheffield. Feel free to get in touch with me via my email address (m.kabiri-chimeh (at) sheffield.ac.uk) or my [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/mozhgankch).

When not working I divide my time between family, movie, artwork and macro-photography!
