## Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry at the University of Sheffield!

As more researchers realise they can produce better quality research more quickly if 
they have some coding and data management skills under their belts 
universities will need to ensure that training in these areas is accessible to those that need it.

Academic institutions will most likely already have courses for teaching highly-specialist subjects 
(such as how to use the local [HPC cluster](http://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/))
but for the more generic aspects of research software development and data management 
there are several obvious choices:

  * Develop and deliver bespoke materials; 
  * Buy in to commercial training packages;
  * Point researchers towards free online resources;

However, there is also a fourth option: 
team up with the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) (SC) and 
[Data Carpentry REF](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) (DC) not-for-profit organisations 
to deliver on-site, interative workshops based on open-source materials that have been 
refined by a large community of SC and DC instructors. 

**Software Carpentry** has developed discipline-agnostic lessons on:
  * programming with Python, R or MATLAB;
  * using databases and [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL);
  * the [UNIX shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell);
  * [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) with git or mercurial;
  * automation using [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)).

**Data Carpentry** lessons look at data management and processing within the context of a specific domain (such as ecology or genomics), focussing on areas such as:
  * the command line;
  * data cleaning and filtering using [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/);
  * data processing and visualisation with Python or R;
  * cloud computing
  * [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)

We should be able to run both Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops at the University of Sheffield soon 
as last week four of us from the University participated in [instructor training in Oxford](https://steve-crouch.github.io/2017-03-16-oxford-ttt/).  
[Tania Allard](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/tania_allard/) and I from the [RSE](http://rse.shef.ac.uk/) team plus [Jez Cope and Beth Hellen](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/libstaff/researchservices) from the Library's Research Services Unit spent two days learning about the SC/DC teaching style and got to practise several aspects of workshop development and delivery.

**TODO**: list some key and/or exciting/interesting aspects of the training course (mention post-it notes, total immersion);

**TODO**: mention benefits to the University (branding / CVs, quality of materials, engaging teaching style, RSE and Library teams meet/connect with researchers)

Once we've completed the [final few tasks](https://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/) required for us to become accredited SC and/or DC instructors 
we'll start organising workshops at the University.  

I must thank the instructors on the training course (Mateuz Kuzak and Steve Crouch) plus [Reproducible Research Oxford](https://rroxford.github.io/) for hosting and organising the event.
