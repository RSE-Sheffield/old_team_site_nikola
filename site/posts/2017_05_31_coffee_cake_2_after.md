The RSE Sheffield team would like to thank everyone for attending the second Coffee and Cakes Event that was held last Wednesday (31/05/2017). The event provided a great opportunity to hear from researchers all around the University about the software engineering challenges faced within their projects. We hope to use the insights gained from the event to help improve your research workflow in the future.
