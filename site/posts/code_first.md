# Mentoring the upcoming generation of Female Coders

![python1](/images/CF_python1.jpg)

It is a well known fact that we are facing a digital and technical skip gap.
Essentially, there are not enough skilled individuals to satisfy the world's
technical and scientific needs. If this were not enough, we are still facing a heavy
gender imbalance in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and manufacture) areas.
With the UK being among the European countries with the smaller number of female
professionals in STEM areas.

If you ask me there are multiple ways to tackle these issues:
- Encourage the hiring of highly skilled immigrants
- Provide wider support for underrepresented minorities
- Leverage inclusive and encouraging environments for those who
demonstrate an interest in STEM areas
- Support and train those willing to make a career change/or follow non-traditonal career paths
- Approach the new generations and provide them with useful skills that would help them
make an informed career choice

The above ideas are by not means *the only* ways to overcome these issues as the gender imbalance and  skill gap issues are rather complex problems.

I do believe, however, that the most fruitful approach is to work with the upcoming generations and provide them with useful technical and personal skills early on. This would not only make them better qualified for their future but would enable them to make informed decisions with regards to their professional future.

[Code First: girls](http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk) is an organizaion that aims to tackle the gender imbalance in three main ways: training women, building a strong and supportive community, and helping companies to train, recruit, and retain their female force.

Belonging to a minority within STEM has lead me to take an active role as an equality and diversity ambassador, which eventually lead me to volunteer as a Python instructor for the Code First courses.
