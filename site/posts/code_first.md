# Mentoring the upcoming generation of Female Coders

![python1](/images/CF_python1.jpg)

It is a well known fact that we are facing a digital and technical skip gap.
Essentially, there are not enough skilled individuals to satisfy the world's
technical and scientific needs. If this were not enough, we are still facing a heavy
gender imbalance in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and manufacture) areas.
With the UK being among the European countries with the smaller number of female
professionals in STEM areas.

If you ask me there are multiple ways to tackle these issues:
- Encourage the hiring of highly skilled immigrants
- Provide wider support for underrepresented minorities
- Leverage inclusive and encouraging environments for those who
demonstrate an interest in STEM areas
- Support and train those willing to make a career change/or follow non-traditonal career paths
- Approach the new generations and provide them with useful skills that would help them
make an informed career choice

The above ideas are by not means *the only* ways to overcome these issues as the gender imbalance and  skill gap issues are rather complex problems.

I do believe, however, that the most fruitful approach would be to work with the upcoming generations and provide them with useful technical and personal skills early on. This would not only make them better qualified for their future but would enable them to make informed decisions with regards to their professional future.
