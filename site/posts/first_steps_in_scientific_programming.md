  </strong> <br> <br>

I have just published this book in electronic and print formats (iBooks + Amazon).
This work aims at providing science and engineering students/post-docs a
series of concepts found in real-life scientific projects, including  concepts of programming, code testing, internal representation,
rounding errors, tricks of the trade, advice on best practice to
store data for long-term usage,  and a broad introduction to the
Unix environment which they will find when coding for HPC and cloud-computing. I do not focus on any individual language but the elements common to all of them. I cover the value of designing the code carefully, planning for future use and scalability, either using flowcharts or just "generic code". I
give an overview of the tools available to tackle different problems.
Sections as diverse as working with existing code and working with
time are covered.  This book is intended to ease the learning curve
for those starting, not for the seasoned scientific programmer.
