RSE Sheffield is hosting another coffee and cakes event on **May 31st at 14:00 in the Ada Lovelace room** on 1st floor of the Computer Science Department (Regents Court East). Attendance is free, but you need to register via [this link](https://goo.gl/forms/L2dRQNvSUvkIbtSm2).

Take the opportunity to come and have an informal chat about research software.

This event is a community event for anyone, not just computer science or members of the RSE team. If you work on software development are an RSE or simply want to talk about some aspect of software or software in teaching then come along.
