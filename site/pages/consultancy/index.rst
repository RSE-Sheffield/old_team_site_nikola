Research Software Engineering
-----------------------------
* I need to make my code faster
* I'd like to make my research software more robust, user friendly and reproducible
* I want advice on how to automate my computational workflow
* How do I increase impact of my research through research software
* I'd like to make use of local or cloud-based High Performance Computing (HPC) resources
* I'd like advice on which software technologies to use

GPU Acceleration
----------------
* I have a large scale compute problem which may be suitable for acceleration with GPUs.
* I am a traditional HPC user and would like to explore how GPUs could be used in my software.
* I want to know more about deep learning on GPUs.
* I would like to use FLAME or FLAME GPU to perform large scale simulations.
* I want to understand how agent based simulations can be used in my research.
