Mike Croucher
-------------
Mike has 10+ years experience supporting scientific software, high performance computing and research software engineering at The University of Manchester and, more recently, the University of Sheffield.  Mike specialises in high-level languages such as MATLAB, R, Python and Mathematica but also has significant experience with compiled languages such as C and Fortran and assists researchers in developing faster, more robust, more usable code. Mike writes about research software on his blog, `www.walkingrandomly.com <http://www.walkingrandomly.com/>`_, which receives over 500,000 visitors annually.

Paul Richmond
-------------
Paul's career as an academic researcher has always been focused on the development of software to support research, predominantly through the application of emerging hardware architectures to complex systems simulation. His technical expertise in GPU computing has led him to work more broadly, engaging with researchers in a wide range of domains to embed accelerated and GPU computing into their research ecosystems. His background in independent research means that he self-identifies as a research software engineer with a strong emphasis on research relating to the application of GPUs.
