Mike Croucher
-------------
Mike is an `EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow <http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=6037>`_ with 10+ years experience supporting scientific software, high performance computing and research software engineering at The University of Manchester and, more recently, the University of Sheffield.  Mike specialises in high-level languages such as MATLAB, R, Python and Mathematica but also has significant experience with compiled languages such as C and Fortran and assists researchers in developing faster, more robust, more usable code. Mike writes about research software on his blog, `www.walkingrandomly.com <http://www.walkingrandomly.com/>`_, which receives over 500,000 visitors annually.

Paul Richmond
-------------
Paul is an `EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow <http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=6037>`_. Paul's career as an academic researcher has always been focused on the development of software to support research, predominantly through the application of emerging hardware architectures to complex systems simulation. His technical expertise in GPU computing has led him to work more broadly, engaging with researchers in a wide range of domains to embed accelerated and GPU computing into their research ecosystems. His background in independent research means that he self-identifies as a `Research Software Engineer <http://www.rse.ac.uk/>`_ with a strong emphasis on research relating to the application of GPUs.

Mozhgan Kabiri Chimeh
---------------------
Mozhgan is a `Research Associate/Research Software Engineer <http://www.rse.ac.uk/>`_ who specialises in performance acceleration targeting Many-core and Multi-core architectures. She completed her PhD in computer science in 2016 at the University of Glasgow where her area of research was accelerating logic gate circuit simulation targeting heterogeneous architectures.  As part of her PhD project, she optimised and accelerated simulation algorithms and applied them to various parallel architectures (SIMD enabled machines, clusters, and GPUs). She has practical experience with parallel programming using High Performance Computing languages and models including OpenMP and CUDA.

Will Furnass
------------
Will is also a `Research Associate/Research Software Engineer <http://www.rse.ac.uk/>`_.
The path to this point has not been particularly direct:
he has a computer scence degree,
has worked as a IT systems engineer in the film industry,
has a PhD plus post-doc experience in water engineering
(where he developed semi-physical and data-driven models of water quality in water distribution networks) and
has provided support to the users of the University of Sheffield's high-performance computing clusters.
In addition he has taught or helped run RSE, water engineering and study skills workshops.
His interests include
helping researchers optimise data analysis workflows (primarily using higher-level languages),
providing training in RSE best practices and
systems administration.
