Research software comes in many forms; from small but useful MATLAB, Python or R scripts with just a handful of users and one developer right through to fully-fledged applications used by large communities of researchers and supported by teams of specialist developers.  We are interested in knowing about all of it.  After all, we live in a time when even a mistake in an `Excel spreadsheet can change the world <http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/microsoft-excel-the-ruiner-of-global-economies/>`_.

This is our attempt at collecting a list of research software that has seen significant input from researchers at the University of Sheffield. If you know about something we've missed, please contact us.

Computer Science
----------------

* `FLAME GPU <http://www.flamegpu.com/home>`_ FLAME GPU is a high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) extension to the FLAME framework. It provides a mapping between a formal agent specifications with C based scripting and optimised CUDA code.
* `General Architecture for Text Engineering (GATE) <https://gate.ac.uk/>`_ GATE is a popular suite of open source language processing tools, used in a wide range of research and commercial areas, with 30 - 40 000 downloads a year.
* `GPy <http://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/>`_ GPy is a Gaussian Process (GP) framework written in Python. Gaussian processes underpin range of modern machine learning algorithms. In GPy, we've used Python to implement a range of machine learning algorithms based on GPs.

Physics
-------
* `GP_emu <https://github.com/samcoveney/GP_emu>`_ GP_emu is designed for building, training, and validating a Gaussian Process Emulator via a series of simple routines.
