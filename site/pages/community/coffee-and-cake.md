Our coffee and cakes events are a social event which allows you to come and informally chat about research software and development within the University of Sheffield research software developer community. The RSE team attend these events and will be happy to talk to you about your research software. 

<!--
The Coffee and Cake event is open to everyone and offers a great opportunity to further discuss the topics raised by RSE community. The event is a community event for anyone, not just computer science or members of the RSE team. <br/>
-->

The event provids a great opportunity to hear from researchers all around the University about the software engineering challenges faced within their projects. We hope to use the insights gained from the event to help improve your research workflow in the future.<br/>

If you have any particular research software issues or would like to have a general discussion about research software or software in teaching, please come along for an informal chat with the RSE team.   Attendance is free. Take the opportunity to come and have an informal chat about research software.
