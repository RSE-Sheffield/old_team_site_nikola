Our coffee and cakes events are a social event which allows you to come and informally chat about research software and development within the University of Sheffield research software developer community. The RSE team attend these events and will be happy to talk to you about your research software. Check the [mailing-list](../) for announcements as to when our next coffee and cakes event is hosted. Coffee and Cake will be provided (the cake is not a lie)!
