We offer and support the delivery of a range of training courses in topics such as Programming, High Performance Computing and Software Engineering. Most of these are free to members of the University of Sheffield.

Check out out complete list of [training events](./events) or find out more about [Software and Data Carpentry](./carpentry).

In the future we aim to run a DDP module on Software Engineering best practice. The design of this module is currently under review for delivery in 2019.
