* **June 14th 2016** Mike Croucher have a tutorial to lecturers in the department of physics about how to use SageMathCloud and Project Jupyter in teaching subjects with a lot of mathematics or simulation. Course material available at [https://github.com/mikecroucher/SMC_tutorial](https://github.com/mikecroucher/SMC_tutorial)
* **May 20th 2016** Mike Croucher delivered an R-awareness course to IT Staff at University of Manchester. Course material available at [https://github.com/mikecroucher/R_awareness](https://github.com/mikecroucher/R_awareness)
* **April 25th 2016** Paul Richmond will be giving a two hour lecture on Performance Optimisation for GPU computing in CUDA. The lecture is part of [COM4521](http://paulrichmond.shef.ac.uk/teaching/COM4521/) on GPU computing but any CUDA developers who are keep on optimising their code are welcome to attend.
* **April 8th 2016** Mike Croucher gave a presentation at the University of Sheffield Chemical Engineering teaching away day on the use of `Project Jupyter and SageMathCloud [http://mikecroucher.github.io/ChemEng_Jupyter_talk2016/](http://mikecroucher.github.io/ChemEng_Jupyter_talk2016/) for teaching computational subjects.
* **March 9th 2016** We ran our first Code Cafe which including a gentle introduction to R. Details and class materials are at [http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5981](http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=5981)
