The course is open to all members of the University but there are two ways of registering, depending on  your status.

# Dates

The next sessions will be delivered throughout November and December 2016. Dates will be released as soon as the timetable is finalised.

# Register as a training course

All members of the University are free to sign up for this course as a non-credit bearing module. An EventBrite page will be created for this soon.

# Register as a DDP module

If you are a PhD student and would like to have this course count towards your DDP credits, you need to register using the [DDP Registration page](https://www.shef.ac.uk/DdpModules/dspReg.html). It is not possible to give a direct link for the course! Instead, you need to search for it.

On the registration page, select your faculty and tick the **A1 - Knowledge base** box before clicking **Apply Filter**. COM605 will be one of the modules that appear.
