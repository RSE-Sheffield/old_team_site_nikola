The [COM605 course](/training/COM605) is open to all members of the University but there are two ways of registering, depending on  your status.

# Dates

The next sessions will be delivered throughout November and December 2016. Dates will be released as soon as the timetable is finalised.

# Register as a training course

All members of the University are free to sign up for this course as a non-credit bearing module. An EventBrite page will be created for this soon.
Sign up to our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/sheffield.ac.uk/forum/#!forum/rse-group) if you want to be notified about this.

# Register as a DDP module

If you are a PhD student and would like to have this course count towards your DDP credits, you need to register by emailing **ddpenquiries@sheffield.ac.uk** and asking to be added to COM605.
