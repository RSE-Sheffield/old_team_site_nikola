.. title: Software, Data and Library Carpentry

.. type: text

[Software Carpentry][soft-carp], [Data Carpentry][data-carp] and [Library Carpentry][lib-carp] are 
training programmes designed to equip researchers (and library staff) 
with the the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. 
A Carpentry workshop is a hands-on, (typically) two-day event that covers 
the core research computing skills needed to be productive in a small research-like environment. 
Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and 
all instruction is done via live coding.

The University of Sheffield is a [Silver member organisation][silver-member] of [The Carpentries][carpentries], 
the organisation that oversees Software and Data Carpentry (and may officially adopt Library Carpentry soon). 
As such we have a number of qualified Carpentry instructors with the ability to train a number of new instructors each year. 
Carpentry events and instructor training are jointly organised by a working group formed of members of:

* RSE Sheffield
* the [Sheffield Bioinformatics Core Facility][bio-inf-core]
* the [Library][library]
* [CiCS][cics]

## Planned Carpentry Events

A number of events are expected to be run on the following days;

* 26th-27th November 2018 - Software Carpentry
* 26th-27th February 2019 - Software or Data Carpentry
* 9th-10th April 2019 - Data Carpentry

Details for these events will be posted on this page and shared via the [RSE announcement mailing list][announce-mail-list].

## Current Instructors

* [Will Furnass][will-furnass] (RSE Sheffield)
* [Jez Cope][jez-cope] (Library)
* [Mike Griffiths][mike-griffiths] (CiCS)

### Becoming an Instructor

If you are interested in becoming an instructor then 
you must first volunteer to help with an existing Carpentry event. 
We can offer to pay you for your time by buying out time on your contract for days spend delivering training. 
The University of Sheffield Carpentries working group will prioritise up to six people per year to become instructors.
