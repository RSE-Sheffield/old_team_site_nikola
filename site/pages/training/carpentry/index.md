Software (and Data) Carpentry is a foundation dedicated to teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. A Software Carpentry workshop is a hands-on, two-day event that covers the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team. Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and all instruction is done via live coding. 

The University of Sheffield is a silver member organisation of the Software Carpentry foundation. As such we have a number of qualified software carpentry instructors with the ability to train a number of new instructors each year. Software Carpentry events and instructor training are jointly organised by a working group formed of members of RSE Sheffield, the Bio-informatics core, the library and CICS. 

## Planned Carpentry Events

A number of events are expected to be run on the following days;

* 26th-27th November 2018 - Software Carpentry
* 26th-27th February 2019 - Software/Data Carpentry

Details for these events will be posted on this page and shared via the RSE mailing list.

## Current Instructors

### Becoming an Instructor

If you are interested in becoming an instructor then you must first volunteer to help with an existing carpentry event. We can offer to pay you for your time by buying out time on your contract for days spend delivering training. The University of Sheffield Software Carpentry working group will prioritise up to six people per year to become instructors.
