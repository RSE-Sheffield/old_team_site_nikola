The RSE group supports research software developers (any researcher who develops software) and research software engineers across the university through our community activities. We run regular social events and seminars as well as providing training code help. Many of these activities are completely free. The best way to keep updated on these is to join our RSE group mailing list. The mailing list is for moderated announcements only (not discussion) but you are welcome to post any announcements which you feel may be of interest to the community (e.g. training or interesting talks and events).
