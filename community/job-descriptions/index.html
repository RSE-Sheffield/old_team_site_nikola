<p>As part of our commitment to developing career pathways for RSEs the RSE group director has been working with Human Resources to formulate a generic RSE job (role) description. These are similar to the published examples for researchers and technical roles on the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/hr/recruitment/atjexamples">university website</a>. RSEs employed on services roles within the RSE team (i.e. not as part of a specific grant) use these job descriptions as part of their formal staff review and development scheme.</p>
<p>The job descriptions are published to aid the wider community in developing job descriptions and career pathways for RSEs. If you are considering employing an RSE at the university of Sheffield then talk to us as we can assist you with aspects of recruitment such as writing job adverts or interviewing.</p>
